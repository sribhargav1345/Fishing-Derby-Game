# Fishing Derby Game

This repository contains code for a custom environment designed for reinforcement learning (RL) tasks of a Fishing Derby Game. The structure of the repository is organized as follows:

- **model.py**: This file contains the code for training the RL model.

- **custom_environment.py**: This file implements the custom environment used for training the RL agent.

- **test.py**: This file is used for testing the trained RL model.

To visualize the game without a trained model, navigate to the env directory:  `cd Custom Environment/custom-environment/env`
Then, run the following command:  `python ./tesr.py`.
This will run the visualization of the game without using any trained model.

To visualize the RL trained model, use the following command: `python ./test.py`

This command will not only visualize the game but also print the output coordinates of agents.
